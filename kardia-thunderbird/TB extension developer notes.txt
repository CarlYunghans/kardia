Notes to help with continuing to develop the Kardia Thunderbird extension:

1. Features to add- places that were set up for a feature to be added, but
where the feature didn't make it there, are commented out and marked with //
FEATURE for easy finding.  All the new feature locations are in
main-overlay.js and main-overlay.xul.

	A. We still need to allow Kardia to-do items to be edited, added, and
deleted from the Lightning calendar.  We also need to import the to-dos to the
Lightning calendar.  The array "allTodos" is set up for importing.  I'm not
sure how much of the code for importing to-do items actually works.  Also, for
any of my code to work, you will need to create an (empty) file called
kardia.ics and add it to the main "kardia@lightsys.org" folder.

	B. We also need to allow the user to choose to record the email currently
being viewed in Kardia and to record all future emails from the given user.

2. For displaying documents, the field e_current_folder must include the full
folder path for the document, including the server address.  This could easily
be modified, though.
