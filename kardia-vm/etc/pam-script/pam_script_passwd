# This runs when a user's password changes.  The purpose of this script is to
# synchronize passwords so that the user's MySQL password and Centrallix
# password (if running as separate users) are also updated.

# From README:
#
#	PAM_SERVICE	- the application that's invoking the PAM stack
#	PAM_TYPE	- the module-type (e.g. auth,account,session,password)
#	PAM_USER	- the user being authenticated into
#	PAM_RUSER	- the remote user, the user invoking the application
#	PAM_RHOST	- remote host
#	PAM_TTY		- the controlling tty
#	PAM_AUTHTOK	- password in readable text
#	PAM_OLDAUTHTOK	- old password in readable text
