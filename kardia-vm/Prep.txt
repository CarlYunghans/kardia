Release Notes for the 1.0 Image:
    The VM is Centos 7
    Created selinux policies for pam-script
      You can add them by doing the following from the kardia_vm dir:
 	for a in *.te; do
	 file=${a/.te}
	 checkmodule -M -m -o $file.mod file.te
	 semodule_package -o $file.pp file.mod
	 semodule -i $file.pp
	done
    smb_pass did not exist for Centos 7 yet.
      This was solved by recompiling samba.
      We compiled the srpm on another machine and changed the spec
	%global with_pam_smbpass 1
      There was a "talloc" bug that gave a memory-leak error with every passwd change
      We commented out a line in lib/util/talloc_stack.c
	Line 199: DEBUG(0, ("no talloc stackframe at %s, leaking memory...
    modified kardia.sh to use "net addr" instead of ifconfig
    modified kardia.sh to use firewalld instead of lokkit
    modified kardia.sh to use systemd instead of init
    modified kardia.sh to use NetworkManager
    used chrony so it handles VM time better
    Centos 7 uses mariadb instead of mysql.  Made changes to that end
    rolled into Centrallix a few changes for Centos 7
    some nicer kardia.sh options
	see the info Centrallix is using
	fail wizard if network is broken
	allow access to mysql from outside the VM
    made the initkardia.sh script more functional

Release Notes for the Beta 4 Image:
    We upgraded the base VM Image to the latest Centos at the time (6.4)
    There are many references to the Centos and VM versions
	These should be put into one spot to be easier to change
    Ended up needing to make a selinux policy file to get pam_smbpass to work
	to install it (download pam_smbpass.te from git):
	# checkmodule -M -m -o pam_smbpass.mod pam_smbpass.te
	# semodule_package -o pam_smbpass.pp pam_smbpass.mod
	# semodule -i pam_smbpass.pp
    Moved many of the "Beta3 Prep" list-items into the initkardia.sh script
    I added a number of rpms that I like to have around
	screen, nmap, tcpdump, strace, locate, etc
    Centos 6 tracks the MAC addresses and what eth# the are
	added a script to yank the entries from /etc/udev/rules/
    Needed to temporarily add rpmforge for the pam_smbpass rpm
	disabled it, but left the repo there
    In the Kardia.sh script:
	I updated the sourceforge ssh key for the new repo
	Changed a number of things to variables to make it easier update
	Updated the wizard to let you skip options & take defaults
    We had some issues with getting the time to register properly
	Made sure /etc/adjtime had UTC in it
	running "kardia.sh setTimezone" fixed it after that
    TODO: (Ideas we had that are not in this release)
	* Allow to get a tagged release (1.0, 1.1) from git instead of the
	latest version.
	    ? Can we pull a list of tagged versions so we can select from list
	* Use variables or something to make the VM version consistent
	* Pull the Centos version from /etc/redhat-release instead of hard-coded
	* Generate /etc/issue.kardia so it uses variables to update versions
	* Have one config file, or a function in kardia.sh that sets the
	* version numbers so initkardia.sh can reference them

=========================================================
Release Notes for the Beta 3 Image:

    Removed some packages: kernel-devel redhat-lsb cups poppler poppler-utils mesa-libGL
    Installed: samba mysql-devel
    Added public key for EPEL
    Installed: epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm (this is for the git packages)
    Installed: git gitk git-gui dialog
    Edited: /root/.vimrc to add centrallix-friendly formatting options to it
    Edited: /root/.bashrc to add vi alias to /usr/bin/vim
    Copied: /root/anaconda-ks.cfg to /root/kickstart.cfg
    Edited: /root/kickstart.cfg to reflect added/removed pkgs
    Edited: /etc/pam.d/system-auth to add smbpasswd sync. This is tricky on RHEL5/CentOS5 boxen - it is not clear how to add pam_smbpass.so. The resulting edited file is lower down on this page.
    Edited: /etc/samba/smb.conf to set node and workgroup names / descriptions, set load printers to 'no', added kardia and centrallix shares.
    Created: /etc/samba/smb.conf.noshares, smb.conf.onerepo, smb.conf.userrepo, for the two different repository sharing modes
    Ran 'lokkit' and set firewall to allow SSH, Samba, and 800:tcp
    Change /etc/sysconfig/network 'HOSTNAME' to kardiadevel
    Edited sudoers (visudo) to allow group kardia_root to sudo.
    Edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow only group kardia_ssh ("AllowGroups kardia_ssh")
    Install Ghostscript -- needed to run PDF reports.
    Install libpng-devel -- needed to run reports with images.
    Disable prelink (to avoid using more disk space than needed during the prelinking process)

The Kickstart file reflects some of the above package choices.  However, redhat-lsb and kernel-devel still had to be removed manually.

Before zipping up the hard disk image, it is useful to fill the hard disk
image up with a very large "zero file".  This overwrites residual deleted
data with something highly compressible, allowing the .zip file of the VM to
be significantly smaller:

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zerofile bs=10240
    sync
    rm /tmp/zerofile
    sync
