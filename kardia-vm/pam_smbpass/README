#For KardiaVM 1_0    2014
This document describes what needed to be done to get pam_smbpass working.
For simplicities sake, we rebuilt all of samba.
    We possibly could have just compiled pam_smbpass

We downloaded the samba source rpm from:
    http://vault.centos.org/

We installed the srpm; it deployed into /root/rpmbuild
We did a: rpmbuild -bp
Then, we edited the spec file in: /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/samba.spec
and changed the line: %global with_pam_smbpass 1
    (changed 0 to 1 - true, we want to build pam_smbpass)
We also wanted to change BUILD/samba/lib/util/talloc_stack.c
That file was spewing error messages:
    pam_smbpass has not been fully updated to work with Samba 4.
    Samba3 used "talloc" to handle various memory allocation and free operations
    Samba4 uses it too, but uses a different method of initializing talloc
    pam_smbpass has not been updated; it expects talloc to be initialize,
	but it has not yet been initialized.  When that happens, it will
	result in a minor memory leak.
    Every time you changed a password or logged in, pam_smbpass was triggered,
	which would result in this error message:
	"no talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory"
    We wanted to remove that error.
We commented out line 199 of BUILD/samba/lib/util/talloc_stack.c, that is the 
    line that generates that error.  That was much faster than understanding
    the whole talloc infrastructure and figuring how pam_smbpass needed to be
    updated to make the memory handling work correctly for Samba4

We also needed to generate another selinux policy to allow pam_smbpass 
    (executed from passwd) to access the samba config files.
